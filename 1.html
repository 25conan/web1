        target="_blank" title="html5 spcification">The Violin Sonata</a> No. 5 in F major, Op. 24, is a sonata
         <strong>by <u>Ludwig van Beethoven</u></strong>. It is often known as the "Spring Sonata" (Frühlingssonate), and was published in 1801. It was dedicated to Count Moritz von Fries, a patron to whom Beethoven also dedicated two other works of the same year—the String Quintet in C major, Op. 29 and the Violin Sonata No. 4—as well as his later Symphony No. 7 in A major, Op. 92.

      <P style="margin-top:35px;">Beethoven initially intended to pair this piece with his Violin Sonata No. 4, Opus 23. As Joseph Szigeti noted, the two pieces complement each other in both key and character. This piece has a more lyrical quality while its intended pairing has a grabbing and agitated touch. However, the two were never published together and thus have different opus numbers. The reason for such a separation is unknown.
